<p>The total amount of registers we have for the third trimester of 2019 in
our scrapping, once deleted repeated adds, is roughly 25675; of which
15562 are apartments and 5489 to houses.</p>
<p>The next table is a summary of total and average squared meters, and
their values in US Dollars for Mar del Plata</p>

</table>
<p>From this table it came out that 82.16% of the supply is composed by
Departamento (60.74%) y Casa (21.42%) and that the apartments have the
highest prices by squared meter and the least change in supply</p>
<p>Likewise the data reveal the variation in quantities, prices and sizes
of each type of housing unit</p>
<p><img src="/img/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" /></p>
<p>In this case we can see, for example, that, for apartments, the rise in
size (total squared meters) causes that, even though the total price
risses, the price by squared meters falls. The oposite occurs for the
PH&rsquo;s</p>
<p>The dataset also provides housing units that have activaly reduce it&rsquo;s
prices in the last three months</p>

</table>
<p>In the table we can see that the average price of apartments drop 8.63%,
meanwhile the prices of the PHs dropped even more, an average of 9.8%.</p>
<p>The housing units that lowered the price also present a series of
features we can exam.</p>
<p>The prices for squared meter that lowered the price are 13.5% cheaper
than the overall average, meaning that those which lower the price were
already cheaper than the overall sample. The same for sizes</p>
<p>The PH&rsquo;s have a peculiar feature. Even though, those which lowered the
price are smaller than the general sample, the price by squared meter is
higher. This is because the difference between the average size si
higher than the difference between the price of the housing unit</p>
<h2 id="real-state-brokers">Real State brokers</h2>
<p>The dataset provides as well, the real state broker since november 2019.
This allows us to evaluate better who is offering.</p>
<p>To begin with, we can see that the majority of the brokers have a few
publications, 77% have less than 22 in this trimester. But there is also
brokers with a lot of publications; 1% of the brokers have between 276
and 419 publications</p>
<p><img src="/img/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" /></p>
<p>This data can also be used to track the market-share of each broker, and
analyse the evolution</p>
<h2 id="zones-of-supply-density">Zones of Supply Density</h2>
<p>The data is geolocated in 97%, which permits us to map it and visualize
the density of the real state supply. As expected, the major density are
near the center of town, near the bus terminal and near the cost; given
that Mar del Plata is a major tourist center</p>
<iframe seamless src="/img/densidad.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
<p>A further anlysis of each zone can be made, so we can describe them</p>
<p><img src="/img/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" /></p>
<p>Overall, how is the supply distributed in each zone?</p>
<p><img src="/img/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" /></p>
<p>Esto nos dice que si bien la zona 6 ocupa el 10% de los m² ofrecidos,
constituye el 26% de las publicaciones. Y, conjuntamente con la zona 5,
son el 25% de los m² ofrecidos, pero superan el 52% del total de
publicaciones. This tell us that, even though zone 6 occupies 10% the m²
offered, is 26% of the publications. And, toghether with zone 5, they
are more than 52% of the publications</p>
<p>The variables than will be described for each zone are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of housing unit</li>
<li>Size in squared meters</li>
<li>Price by squared meter</li>
<li>Total price</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="type">Type</h3>
<p>Below, we can see that the zone of least density (zone 0), the market is
composed mainly with land and houses. And as we advance to the zone of
major density (zone 6) the composition of the supply varies. In the
first place, the land are no longer offered, the apartments takes over
as the main type and in the center of town also appears comercial shops
and garages</p>
<p><img src="/img/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" /></p>
<p>This is exactly what one would expect, if the housing unit is smaller,
more units fit in a given space</p>
<h3 id="sizes">Sizes</h3>
<p>The sizes of each unit play a fundamental role in the geographical
concentration of the supply</p>
<p><img src="/img/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" /></p>
<p>As we saw in the &ldquo;Type&rdquo; section, we can quantify how the types which are
traditionaly the largest (houses, land) affect the concentration</p>
<h3 id="prices">Prices</h3>
<p>The prices in each area are more homogeneous than the sizes or any other
variable previously analyse. There is still a tendency that more supply
means less prices. For example, the least average price is in zone 6</p>
<p><img src="/img/unnamed-chunk-12-2.png" /></p>
<p>This information, doesn&rsquo;t reflect how the prices varies in each zone.
Prices in zone 6 may be the least, in average, but this prices hide a
major variabilty. Prices in zone 6 have 50% variation than in zone 0.
Meaning that, even though the prices are lower, in average, there are a
lot with higher prices, and with lower prices. And in zones where houses
are the main unit, the prices are more steady</p>
<h3 id="price-by-squared-meter">Price by squared meter</h3>
<p>This a sort of conclution of the two previous parts. We saw that the
units gets larger in less concentrated areas, and the total prices
doesn&rsquo;t change that much. This means that the prices by squared meter
will be higher there where there is a major supply concentration</p>
<p><img src="/img/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" /></p>
<h3 id="as-price-zones">As price zones&hellip;</h3>
<p>The same methology can be used to extract different zones, Prices,
number of rooms, etc which can be made ad hoc</p>
